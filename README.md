Number Operations Project

The Number Operations project is a Java program that lets users enter two numbers and performs different arithmetic operations on them. 
The program can add, subtract, multiply, and divide the numbers. 
It also checks that the user enters valid numbers and allows them to repeat the process as many times as they want.

See
The program asks the user to input two numbers.
It checks if the input is valid (only numbers are accepted).
It performs the following operations:
Addition (sum)
Subtraction (difference)
Multiplication (product)
Division (quotient)
The user can choose whether to perform another calculation or exit.
How to Run the Program

Instructions
Clone or download the project files to your computer.
Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.
Run the NumberOperations.java file.
When the program asks for numbers, type two numbers (they can be whole numbers or decimal numbers).
After the results are shown, the program will ask if you want to do another calculation. Type yes to continue or no to exit.
Example

      Enter the first number: 10
      Enter the second number: 5
      The sum of 10.00 and 5.00 is 15.00
      The difference of 10.00 and 5.00 is 5.00
      The product of 10.00 and 5.00 is 50.00
      The quotient of 10.00 and 5.00 is 2.00
      Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no):
